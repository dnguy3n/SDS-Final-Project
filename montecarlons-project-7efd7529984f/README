Principal Components
1. Grid Setup
2. Sampling Methods
3. Navier-Stokes Solver
4. Result output & comparison

"problem.c" is the main file that runs everything
    -first it specifies the initial conditions 
    -then chooses a grid
    -then chooses a sampling method and samples to fill the temperature array
    -then the nv solver uses finite differences to create a new temperature array one timestep forward
    -after a specified number of timesteps we output the result
